# IconForge-Docs

Stunning icons, powerful styling, and a blazing-fast JIT engine. All in one place.

IconForge is a utility-first icon system that scans your HTML for icon classes and generates only the CSS you need, thanks to its Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler. It offers a massive library of icons and a rich set of utility classes to customize size, color, rotation, animations, and more, directly in your HTML.
